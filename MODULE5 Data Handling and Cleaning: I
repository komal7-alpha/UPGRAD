Frequency of Mode
Once you impute the missing values for Current Ver. as mentioned towards the end of the above video, answer the following question. If you’re having some difficulties in doing the same, check the feedback

After the imputation step, how many values in Current Ver. are of the type “Varies with Device”?
 
 
 1419

✓ Correct
Feedback:
Use the following code to replace the null values

inp1['Current Ver'] = inp1['Current Ver'].fillna(inp1['Current Ver'].mode()[0])
inp1['Current Ver'].isnull().sum()

#After that do a value_counts()
inp1['Current Ver'].value_counts()
You’ll see that a total of 1419 values are 'Varies with Device'.
 

Mode
As you just learned, one way to impute missing values for the categorical variable is to use mode. Can you find which value occurs the maximum number of times?

 

You will find the inbuilt mode functionality useful for this question. You may also use the value_counts() functionality of pandas Series.

4.1 and above

✓ Correct

Please continue the video for further explanation.

Frequency of Mode
You just now found out the mode of the categorical variable, what is the frequency it occurs with?

2059
✓ Correct
Suggested Answer
You can do this using value_counts(), this is one of the most used functionalities of pandas. Another workaround the same is to filter the data frame using the condition and then to find its length.

len(inp1[inp1['Android Ver']=='4.1 and above'])

Null Values
Check the number of nulls in the dataframe again and find the total number of null values

There are a total of 8 null values across all the columns.

✓ Correct
Feedback:
Write inp1.isnull.sum() function once again. You should get 8 null values remaining.
