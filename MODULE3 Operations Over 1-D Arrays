Indexing Array
Given an array:

array_1 = [1,2,3,5,4,6,7,8,5,3,2]
What will be the output of the code provided below?

print(array_1[:3])

[1, 2, 3]

✓ Correct
Feedback:
The function only gives the first three entries, and this answer follows that.

Given an array:

array_1 = [1,2,3,5,4,6,7,8,5,3,2]
What will be the output of the code provided below?

print(array_1[2:-3])
 


[3 5 4 6 7 8]
 

✓ Correct
Feedback:
The desired values start from the third entry (included) in the array until the third last entry (excluded).

Given an array:

array_1 = [1,2,3,5,4,6,7,8,5,3,2]
What will be the output of the code provided below?
(Hint: The syntax is [starting value : end value : step value])

print(array_1[ : : -2])


[2, 5, 7, 4, 3, 1]
 

✓ Correct
Feedback:
Correct Answer! The syntax is [starting value : end value : skip value]. Here, since the skip value is negative, it means that we will start from the opposite direction take every second value in the array

How would you extract all the elements with an odd index in a given array?
(Hint: Odd index refers to the position of the element, not the actual value)

array[1: : 2]
✓ Correct
Feedback:
The syntax here will give all the elements at odd indices.

                               
                               
                               
                               
                               
                               
                               Extracting Elements from Array
Description
From a given array, extract all the elements which are greater than 'm' and less than 'n'. Note: 'm' and 'n' are integer values provided as input.



Input format:

A list of integers on line one

Integer 'm' on line two

Integer 'n' on line three



Output format:

1-D array containing integers greater than 'm' and smaller than 'n'.





Sample input:

[ 1, 5, 9, 12, 15, 7, 12, 9 ] (array)

6 (m)

12 (n)



Sample output:

[ 9 7 9 ]





Sample input:

[ 1, 5, 9, 12, 15, 7, 12, 9 ]

12

6



Sample output:

[ ]
