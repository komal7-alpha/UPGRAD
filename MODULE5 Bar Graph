Bar Graph
Is it possible to have a separate colour for each category in a bar graph?


Yes

✓ Correct
Feedback:
Colours can be provided as a list to the matplotlib.pyplot.bar function under the attribute ‘color’.: matplotlib.pyplot.bar(x, y, color = [‘red’, ‘blue’, ‘green’]) [Note: if there are more than three bars, the colours will start repeating themselves.]
