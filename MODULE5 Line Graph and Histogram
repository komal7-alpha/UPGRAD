Specifying Line Style
Let's say 'x' and 'y' are two lists that you want to plot. You have initialised matplotlib.pyplot as plt. Now, you want to plot a blue line with cross (x) as markers for your points. What is the function call for this?
For your reference, here is the official documentation of the Pyplot API.

plt.plot(x, y, 'b', marker = 'x') plt.show()
Feedback:
The syntax for plotting a line graph is plt.plot(x_component, y-component, 'graph_features'). You have to specify the marker as a separate attribute to plot a line graph.


Histogram
You are provided with a list of weights of individuals stored as float:
list_1 = [48.49, 67.54, 57.47, 68.17, 51.18, 68.31, 50.33, 66.7, 45.62, 43.59, 53.64, 70.08, 47.69, 61.27, 44.14, 51.62, 48.72, 65.11]

You want to check which bucket has maximum entries when divided into the following four groups:

[40-50)
[50-60)
[60-70)
[70-80)
Which code will help you find the correct answer? For your reference, here is the official documentation of the Pyplot API.

plt.hist(list_1, bins = 4, range =[40, 80], edgecolor = 'white')
âœ“ Correct
Feedback:
This is the correct answer. You are provided with four bars representing the desired ranges.
