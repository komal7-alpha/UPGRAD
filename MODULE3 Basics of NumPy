              Creating an Array
Select the correct option to create a 1-d array using the following elements (1.0, 2, 3.5, 0.2, True). 
(Note that ‘True’ must be provided as a Boolean value, not as a string.)

np.array( [1.0, 2, 3.5, 0.2, True] )
✓ Correct
Feedback:
This is the correct answer. You have to provide the elements in the form of a list or a tuple to form an array. Also, a Boolean value is defined without the apostrophes.

          NumPy Array
What is the default data type of each element in the array created in the previous question?

Float

✓ Correct
Feedback:
Float can accommodate the integer values; hence, all the values are converted to float. Check the output in Jupyter notebook to confirm.

                                Creating an array
Is it possible to create an array from a tuple?


Yes

✓ Correct
Feedback:
Yes, NumPy arrays can be created using a tuple. Any sequence that has an array-like structure can be passed to the np.array function.
