Box Plot
Find the interquartile range for the box plot created over the following list:
list_1 = [48.49, 67.54, 57.47, 68.17, 51.18, 68.31, 50.33, 66.7, 45.62, 43.59, 53.64, 70.08, 47.69, 61.27, 44.14, 51.62, 48.72, 65.11]
[Hint: use np.percentile to find the percentile values]

This is the correct answer. The IQR can be calculated by finding the 25th and 75th percentile values.



Types of Plots
Which of the following plots can be used to show the relationship between two quantitative variables?

1. Box plot
2. Line plot
3. Scatter plot
4. Histogram

2 and 3

✓ Correct
Feedback:
Correct Answer! A line plot and a scatterplot essentially plot the x-y relationship between two quantitative variables. They show how one variable changes with respect to another quantitative variable. To find a relationship using a line plot, one additional step that you have to complete is to first sort the elements of x-axis.
